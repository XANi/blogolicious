Blogolicious
============

[Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/) based blog platform; at least that is the target.
It is my personal code playground (started from "how hard developing a frontend can be", both for Perl code and HTML/JS shenaningans.

Targets:

* Relatively simple to modify; adding new storage backend or parse should only require writing few basic functions to work
* Write and publish blogposts with plain text files, optionally in git repo
* Fast, event-based (at least mostly, some parts WiP)


Doc index:

* [API](doc/API.md)

my $text = q{**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the _1500s_, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the _1960s_ with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like **Aldus PageMaker** including versions of Lorem Ipsum.};
